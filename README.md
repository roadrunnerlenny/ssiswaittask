# SSIS Wait Task
A SSIS task which suspends execution for a period or until a specific time. Additionally, a sql statement can be defined that can also delay execution.

# Features
Use it as a simple "Sleep" task - e,g. just delay execution of all following tasks for a couple of minutes
Use it as a scheduler - e.g. define a time when your package (or a part of it) is executed
Use it to wait for an event in your database - e.g. just execute something in your package when a particular value in your database was set
